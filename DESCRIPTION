Description: A collection of tools for doing various analyses of
    multi-state QTL data, with a focus on visualization and interpretation.
    The package 'multistateQTL' contains functions which can remove or impute 
    missing data, identify significant associations, as well as categorise features into global,
    multi-state or unique. The analysis results are stored in a 'QTLExperiment' object, 
    which is based on the 'SummarisedExperiment' framework.
